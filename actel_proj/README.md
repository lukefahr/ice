ICE FPGA HDL
============

This code is synthesized using [Microsemi Libero 11.5.3.10](http://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/design-software/libero-soc) and loaded onto the ICE board's AGLN250V2 FPGA using a [FlashPro4](http://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro) programmer.  
Fully synthesized images can be found in the [fpga_images](fpga_images/) directory.

NOTE: More recent versions of Libero (11.6+) have had issues meeting the size requirements imposed by the IGLOO nano FPGA.
